# Jump-Start Training

Goal of the Jump-Start Training is to have an onboarding onto how Python projects should be setup at b.telligent.

A lot of best practices from past project flowed into the recommendations for structures and basic setups. 
That does not mean that there isn't room to improvement. Everything is up for discussion of better solutions come along.


## Setup Requirements for Jump-Start Training

### Install Python Locally

Either go to our Company Portal or to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install a recent Python 3.9 on your system.
Please do not install anything older than Version 3.9 since some examples might not be working. 
As of March 2022 Python 3.10 is also acceptible but not yet recommended, since you probably cannot use 3.10 at 
customers yet anyway.

### Install GIT locally
Install GIT via the Company Portal if not yet already done.

### Install the Jetbrains Toolbox
Install the Jetbrains Toolbox from https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/

This little helper allows you to install any Jetbrains product and even different versions of the same products in   
parallel, like PyCharm Community Edition and PyCharm Professional Edition.

IF YOU ARE ASKED FOR ADMIN-RIGHTS, just click on cancel and it will continue. There is no downside or incomplete 
installation if you don't have admin rights (confirmed by Jetbrains).

### Install PyCharm Professional via the Jetbrains Toolbox

Look through the available tools and install PyCharm Professional. 
If you are using Python in a b.telligent project you have to use the Professional Edition since this is the only 
one that can execute code on remote servers instead of pulling sensitive data on your personal laptop.

The Professional Edition can either be directly activated with a license key (can be requested from IT) 
or for the sake of the training with a temporary test license.
In order o activate the test license, you need to follow the instructions and create a login with your company email  
for JetBrains, sooner or later you'll need it probably anyway.
